"Sets are such a basic notion in mathematics that the only way to ‘define’ them
is by synonyms like collection, class, grouping and so on. A set is completely
characterised by the elements it contains.
There are two main ways of defining a set: (1) by explicitly listing all its
elements or (2) by giving a property that all elements must satisfy."
- from http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszvc/g51mcs/ch04_sets.pdf

The main difference between sets and array is that you cannot repeat values in a set, and sets are keyed not indexed (so lookup is faster).
Sets are better for keep track of TYPES or ATTRIBUTES of items rather than the number of them. It's better at keeping a log of all the types of fruit in your fruit salad, but not the number of each fruit you used (since values cannot be repeated).
